Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.  

In this course, you'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like ``.map()`` and ``.filter()``.  

## Learn About Functional Programming

Functional programming is about:  

1. Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
2. Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output
3. Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlle

## Understand Functional Programming Terminology

Functional terminology:  

**Callbacks** are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function.  

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called **first class functions**. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.  

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called **higher order** functions.  

When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a **lambda**.
