Data can be stored and accessed in many ways. You already know some common JavaScript data structures â€” arrays and objects.  

In this Basic Data Structures course, you'll learn more about the differences between arrays and objects, and which to use in different situations. You'll also learn how to use helpful JS methods like ``splice()`` and ``Object.keys()`` to access and manipulate data.  `

## Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data

**Array.length** - length property.  

**one-dimensional array** - meaning it only has one level, or that it does not have any other arrays nested within it.  

**multi-dimensional array** - an array that contains other arrays.  

## Access an Array's Contents Using Bracket Notation

**index** - JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element of an array is actually at the zeroth position.  

**bracket notation** - In order to retrieve an element from an array we can enclose an index in brackets and append it to the end of an array, or more commonly, to a variable which references an array object.  

## Add Items to an Array with push() and unshift()

arrays are **mutable**  

``push()`` method adds elements to the end of an array.  

``unshift()`` adds elements to the beginning.  

## Remove Items from an Array with pop() and shift()

``pop()`` removes an element from the end of an array - no parameters - only allows an array to be modified by a single element at a time.  

``shift()`` removes an element from the beginning - no parameters - only allows an array to be modified by a single element at a time.  

## Remove Items Using splice()

remove any number of consecutive elements from anywhere in an array  

_can take up to 3 parameters_  
- first parameter represents the index on the array from which to begin removing elements, 
- while the second parameter indicates the number of elements to delete,

## Add Items Using splice()

- the third parameter, comprised of one or more element(s), to add to the array.  

## Copy Array Items Using slice()

## Copy an Array with the Spread Operator

## Combine Arrays with the Spread Operator

## Check For The Presence of an Element With indexOf()

## Iterate Through All an Array's Items Using For Loops

## Create complex multi-dimensional arrays

## Add Key-Value Pairs to JavaScript Objects

## Modify an Object Nested Within an Object

## Access Property Names with Bracket Notation

## Use the delete Keyword to Remove Object Properties

## Check if an Object has a Property

## Iterate Through the Keys of an Object with a for...in Statement

## Generate an Array of All Object Keys with Object.keys()

## Modify an Array Stored in an Object
