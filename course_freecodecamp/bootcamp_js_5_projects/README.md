# [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects)

This is it — time to put your new JavaScript skills to work. These projects are similar to the algorithm scripting challenges you've done before – just much more difficult.

Complete these 5 JavaScript projects to earn the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.

## Palindrome Checker

Return ``true`` if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return ``false``.

A _palindrome_ is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

__Note:__ You'll need to remove __all non-alphanumeric characters__ (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as ``racecar``, ``RaceCar``, and ``race CAR`` among others.

We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as ``2A3*3a2``, ``2A3 3a2``, and ``2_A3*3#A2``.
