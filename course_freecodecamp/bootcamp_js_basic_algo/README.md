An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.  

To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code.  

In this course, you'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.  

## Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

The algorithm to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times ``9/5``, plus ``32``.  

## Reverse a String

Convert string to array...

## Factorialize a Number

If the integer is represented with the letter ``n``, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to ``n``.  

Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation ``n!``  

For example: ``5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120``  

Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function.
